                Any condition requiring long-term caregiving is never easy or
                simple to manage. It is a proven fact that the level of
                awareness in a patient can never be known by anyone.
                Nevertheless, their inability to respond, communicate or move
                voluntarily is first and foremost considered, studied and
                responded appropriately to; when caring for them.
